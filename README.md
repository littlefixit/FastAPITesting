# FastAPITesting 

This script is where we'll fiddle with FastAPI.

### Installation Instructions
- `pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart`

### How to Use
From the command line, you can run the example with 
`uvicorn main:app --reload`

You'll see an `INFO` message telling you which port it starts on locally (likely `8000`)
